    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 ounces bourbon</li>
        <li>3 cups premium vanilla ice cream</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons chocolate syrup, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place four heavy pint glasses in the freezer to chill for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Add the bourbon, ice cream, milk, and four tablespoons of the chocolate syrup to a 
            powerful blender.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add three ice cubes, and blend until smooth. (If the mixture seems too thin, add 
            another 1/4 to 1/2 cup of ice cream and blend again.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide evenly among the prepared pint glasses, and top each with 1/2 tablespoon of 
            the remaining chocolate syrup.
        </li>
        <li>Serve immediately</li>
    </ol>
