    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt 
            or tube pan. Combine diced apples, 1 tablespoon white sugar, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon 
            in a medium bowl; set aside. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt; set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine 2 cups white sugar, oil, orange juice, vanilla, and eggs in a large bowl; beat 
            with an electric mixer at high speed until smooth. Stir in flour mixture. Fold in chopped 
            walnuts.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour 1/3 of the batter into prepared pan. Sprinkle with 1/2 of the apple mixture. Alternate 
            layers of batter and filling, ending with batter.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of cake comes out clean, 
            about 55 to 60 minutes. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack and 
            cool completely. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar.
        </li>
